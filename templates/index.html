            <h2>Welcome to the COVID-19 Dashboard Project!</h2>
            <p1>Brought to you by Eltahir Gotar <a target="_blank" href="https://gotar1.github.io/">@gotar</a></p1><br><br>
            <p2>The purpose of this project is building an interactive dashboard and map of COVID-19 pandemic using updated data from CDC. <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36"target="_blank" role="button">Raw Infection Data</a>
                <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc"target="_blank" role="button">Raw Vaccine Data</a>
            </p><br> 
              COVID-19 is a new virus and as such there is not enough data to do an in depth analysis. However as the virus continues to spread
              at an alarming rate throughout the United States and the world, we can study the collected infection data and look for any trends
              and patterns about the rates of infection, death and recovery. And compare States numbers to figure out who is doing well and who is failing.</p><br>

            <p3>We built an interactive dashboard for all US States and territories. It shows total numbers of cases, total death and death
            percentage, total recovery and recovery percentage. We built horizontal bar chart to show total cases and death numbers. Line             
            chart to show State curves with total cases numbers and death percent and a gauge chart for recovery percent. Since CDC data is aggregated, 
            and they used moving average, we cleaned the data to show latest stats, so all numbers are the total up to that point from the start of the pandemic.</p><br>
           
            <p5>We also built two maps to show total numbers for pandemics and vaccine stats for all states. You select dataset and hover over a State to see
                total cases of COVID-19, total death and total recovered. For vaccine map you acan see total doses distributed and administered and percentage per 100k of population.</p><br>

            <p4>Our analysis shows that, the death rate is going down despite increased new cases of infection. This could be attributed to medical
            professionals getting used to the virus and may be developing new protocols on how to treat COVID-19 patients and the effectiveness
            of different medications and medical procedures currently in use. However, all States failed to level the infection curve despite all
            measures taken. Even States with mandated shutdown and strict mask and social distancing procedures failed to level their curve. We 
            may need to develope new procedures to deal with this virus and any similar future viral infections.</p><br>
